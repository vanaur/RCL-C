## TL;DR
A compiler frontend and backend library that allows the evaluation, analysis and compilation of programs, through an abstract stack-based virtual machine whose intermediate representation follows the concatenative paradigm; optimized for implicit data vectorization, big numbers and recursive passage styles.

The library provides compilation help features adapted to all types of languages and paradigms.

## The project idea
The Runtime Core Library, abbreviated RCL, is a high-level program compilation, evaluation and diagnostic library.

The library provides everything you need to adapt the compilation to your language constructs and also gives access to a wide range of prefabricated compilation help modules, including full support for imperative paradigm, functional paradigm, object paradigm, logical paradigm, and expression evaluation methods: strict, lazy, and perhaps optimistic (to plan).

The execution machine is based on an abstract and high-level stack-based IR language following the concatenative paradigm. The means of evaluation are interpretation, JIT and AOT compilation. Code generation (to compile into an executable / JIT) is fully optimized for recursion, parallelism (SMID), asynchronous execution, very large numbers computation, memory management, as well as the size of the resulting file.

**The goal** of the RCL is to provide a way to compile, evaluate and diagnose, all in one, high level, theoretical IR from an abstract VM.

## Getting Started
The project is not sufficiently developed to be available from a package manager. In the meantime, you can build it from the makefile, which has been written in such a way as to accompany you as best as possible.

### Prerequisites

The dependencies of external dynamic libraries are:

 - [libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/)
 - [gmp](https://gmplib.org/)

The programs needed to build the project:

 - Makefile
 - GCC

## Installing

At the moment, with `make`:

```
cd RCL/
make LIB & make DLL & make VM & make clean
```

Will build the VM as executable one, the library as dynamic linking one and as static linking one.

## Testing and examples

<details><summary><b>Use the executable</b></summary>

The generated executable allows you to use the VM (only) through the REPL, but can also run entire files and programs.

Launch the executable with the option **`--repl`** and enter the interactive environment.

| HELP    	| Display the help menu                                         	|
| TYPEOF  	| Determines the type of the given expression                   	|
| STEP    	| Evaluates the given expression steps by steps                 	|

| EXECT   	| Evaluates the given expression and display the execution time 	|

| OPT     	| /                                                             	|
| SHOW    	| /                                                             	|

You can enter an arithmetic expression with the reverse Polish syntax: `3 7 + 2 * 10 /`. Think of it as instructions on a stack:

```arm
load 3
load 7
add
load 2
mul
load 10
div
```

You can also send an IR file to the executable, it will evaluate it, for example:
```rust
.define
    // An optimized factorial function (with recursion)
    fac_acc =
        dup 1 swap lw quote
            [pop]
            [dup flip * swap -- fac_acc]
        ifte ;
    fac = 1 swap fac_acc ;

.main
    817 x\
    "The factorial of x = " puts
    x fac nvshow puts
```

To evaluate a file, simply pass it as a program argument. You can always use the REPL over it, as well as the functions that have been defined in the program.

<details><summary><b>Use the library</b></summary>

If you're using the library, make sure that the [header files](include/) are accessible from your compiler. and of course the library that you can link with `-lrcl`. Make sure these files are accessible from the command prompt you're using to build and testing.

All the features you'll need will be found in `RCL\Library\`.

The function `rcl_hello_world()` can be used from `RCL\Library\rclib.h`, it will display a `Hello, world!` for the RCL:

```c
#include <RCL\Library\rclib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // Calling the 'Hello, world!' function
    rcl_hello_world();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
If you want something more concrete, you can describe the AST of a program:

```c
#include <RCL\Library\rclib.h>
#include <RCL\Library\Primitive\Expression.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    rcl_expr_t cst_n1 = rcl_expr_cst_int(4);
    rcl_expr_t cst_n2 = rcl_expr_cst_int(8);
    rcl_expr_t my_exp = rcl_expr_add(cst_n1, cst_n2);

    printf("Input: 4 + 8\n");
    printf("RCL display: %s\n", rcl_show_ir_expr(my_exp));
    
    struct IResult res = rcl_evali_expr(my_exp);

    printf("Resulting: %d\n", res.main_returned);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Or, if you don't like variables:

```c
#include <RCL\Library\rclib.h>
#include <RCL\Library\Primitive\Expression.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    rcl_expr_t my_exp =
        rcl_expr__mul(
            rcl_expr__var("4"),
            rcl_expr__add(
                rcl_expr__cst_int(3),
                rcl_expr__div(
                    rcl_expr__var("6"),
                    rcl_expr__cst_int(2))));

    printf("Input: 4 * (3 + (6 / 2))\n");
    printf("RCL display: %s\n", rcl_show_ir_expr(my_exp));
    
    struct IResult res = rcl_evali_expr(my_exp);

    printf("Resulting: %d\n", res.main_returned);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Compile: `gcc -lrcl main.c -o main`.

Don't worry, it sounds barbaric when you put it that way, but what we've done here is really nothing more than the work your compiler will do from AST nodes.

## Contributing

If you have constructive questions, suggestions for improvements or features to be added, bug or performance reports, then check if a report has not already been raised in [issues](https://github.com/vanaur/RCL/issues), in which case it has probably already been processed or is being maintained, otherwise feel free to do so and/or actively participate in the project by forking it. Amendments will be made if they are relevant.

## Version 2.0 Forecast

The current version is a prototype under construction which aims to be really usable (I'd like in any case ðŸ˜›). This version is therefore relatively rigid to extensions and customizations as well as limited in terms of code generation backend or optimizations.

The RCL 2.0 version should build on this prototype in order to extend its capabilities to allow you to broaden your quality and personality for compiling and evaluation.

Indeed, version 2.0 provides a very modular and customizable as well as very easily usable and exportable way to extend the RCL's functionalities. Here are the key features that this version will try to achieve:

 - Customization of optimization runs ;
 - Definition of compilation options ;
 - Definition of new compilation and JIT backends ;
 - Definition of customized optimizations on IR ;
 - Definition of customized optimizations on the backend. 

The configurations would be done through the analysis of a Json file.
